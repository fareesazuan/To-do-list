# To-do-list
 To-Do List App with CSS Animation
This app will allow users to create a to-do list and visually check off completed tasks.

Adding Functionality (Optional):

While focuses on the HTML and CSS structure, optionally we can add Javascript to the index.html file to handle user interaction. This could include:
- Adding new tasks to the list when the user clicks the "Add" button.
- Checking/unchecking tasks when the user clicks on the checkbox.

Adding Animations:
The style.css file includes a commented section where we can add CSS animations to make checking off tasks more visually appealing.
